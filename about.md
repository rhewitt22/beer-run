My New Years resolution is to run more miles than the number of beers I drink in 2015; this site is here to keep score.  This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) because use static site generators to do just about anything.  When paired with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) I can post a run, ride, or beer to update the site from anywhere using my phone all for FREE!
